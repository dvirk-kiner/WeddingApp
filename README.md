# WeddingApp
This is a mini project for my wedding. This is a web page that every one can enter using a smartphone and uploading pictures to the server

## installation
1. Copy all the files to the public directory on the server.
2. Create a new directory called "images".
3. Enable in the Php.in file / server setting to upload files.
4. Go into your URL and enjoy :)
